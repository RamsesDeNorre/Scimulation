Scimulation, a Scala simulation framework.

The code can be compiled by regular scalac and several runnable examples are
contained in the src/example directories.
These examples extend the App trait and can be run as such.

The test suite uses the ScalaTest library, which can be found in the lib folder.

For graphical output, a UbiGraph server has to be running,
because this server is architecture dependent, we did not include a copy.
The server can be downloaded from
    http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Downloads/
by choosing the right target architecture.

Furthermore, all libraries under lib should be included on the classpath and
all the .xml files should be in the working dir of the application.
